# PokéAPI

[![Built with APIMatic][apimatic-badge]][apimatic-url] [![License: MIT][license-badge]][license-url]

The PokéAPI SDK for .NET provides access to the [PokéAPI REST APIs](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) from .NET applications.

All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through a modern free open-source RESTful API.

## What is this?

This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.

## Where do I start?

We have awesome [documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) on how to use this API. It takes minutes to get started.

This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.

Created by [**Paul Hallett**](https://github.com/phalt) and other [**PokéAPI contributors**](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi#contributing) around the world. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.

## Installation

Add the .NET SDK as a project reference into your solution:

```bash
dotnet add reference <path-to-sdk>/PokApi.csproj
```

---

## Quick Start

### Dependency Injection

Register the client with `IServiceCollection` and resolve it from the container. The `HttpClient` is managed by `IHttpClientFactory`. Configure the client's behavior through [PokApiClientOptions](PokApiClientOptions.cs).

```csharp
services.AddPokApiClient(options =>
    {
        options.Environment = ServerEnvironment.Production;
        // TODO: configure more client options here
    });
```

### Direct Instantiation

Create the client by passing an `HttpClient` you manage yourself. Configure the client's behavior through [PokApiClientOptions](PokApiClientOptions.cs).

```csharp
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
// TODO: configure more client options here
var options =
    new PokApiClientOptions
    {
        Environment = ServerEnvironment.Production,
    };
var client = new PokApiClient(httpClient, options);
```

## Usage

For code examples and error responses, see [API Reference](api-reference.md).

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> Use a **single `PokApiClient` instance** for the lifetime of your application and
> reuse it across all requests. Creating a new instance per request might exhaust the
> connection pool.
